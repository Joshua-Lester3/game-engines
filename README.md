# Game Engines

Starting this repo after gaining some interest in low level programming, especially when programming game engines. I plan to follow a couple of tutorial-ish playlists on youtube, such as Handmade Hero and the Hazel Game Engine series, then move on toward possibly using what I've learned to create my own :)

I'm starting with Handmade Hero - I'll keep a separate branch for that series (and another one for the Hazel Game Engine), so check that branch out to see my progress.
